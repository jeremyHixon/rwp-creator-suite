# Guest Teaser Implementation - Content Repurposing Engine

## Strategy Overview
Implement a freemium experience for guest users using **Platform Limitation + Attempt Counter** approach to encourage registration.

## Guest User Experience

### Free Access (3 Attempts)
- **Full Twitter generation**: Complete 280-character optimized content
- **Platform previews**: Show first 50-100 characters of LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram versions
- **Attempt tracking**: localStorage counter, clear remaining attempts display
- **Value demonstration**: Show what they're missing without full access

### Preview Format
For restricted platforms, show:
```
LinkedIn version: "In today's digital landscape, businesses are increasingly..."
[Sign up to see full version]

Facebook version: "Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Just discovered something amazing about..."
[Sign up to see full version]

Instagram version: "âœ¨ Transform your content strategy with this one simple..."
[Sign up to see full version]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Guest State Tracking (localStorage)
- `content_repurposer_attempts`: Number of uses (max 3)
- `content_repurposer_first_use`: Timestamp for potential reset logic
- `content_repurposer_shown_platforms`: Track which previews they've seen

### Content Generation Logic
1. **All Users**: Generate complete content for all platforms via AI
2. **Guests**: Return full Twitter + truncated others with upgrade prompts
3. **Logged-in**: Return all complete content

### UI/UX Elements
- **Attempt counter**: "2 free attempts remaining" 
- **Platform tabs**: Show all platforms, disable restricted ones with lock icons
- **Upgrade prompts**: Clear, non-aggressive messaging about benefits
- **Preview quality**: Make truncated content compelling, not frustrating

## Privacy Compliance
- No guest data sent to server
- All tracking client-side only
- No email capture at this stage
- Respect existing privacy-first architecture

## Conversion Messaging

### Progressive Disclosure
1. **First use**: Focus on tool functionality
2. **Second use**: Mention additional platforms available  
3. **Third use**: Clear upgrade benefits and registration CTA

### Value Proposition
- "Unlock professional LinkedIn posts"
- "Get engaging Facebook content"
- "Access Instagram-optimized versions with hashtags"
- "Save unlimited content variations"

## Technical Requirements

### Guest Limitations
- 3 total attempts (not per platform)
- Full Twitter generation only
- 50-100 character previews for other platforms
- No content saving/history
- No advanced features (if implemented later)

### Logged-in Benefits
- Unlimited attempts
- All platforms fully generated
- Content history/saving (if implemented)
- Advanced features access

### Upgrade Flow
- Smooth transition from guest to logged-in state
- Preserve current content in progress
- Clear explanation of new capabilities
- Optional: import guest-generated content to user account

## Implementation Considerations

### User Experience
- Don't frustrate guests with too many restrictions
- Make free Twitter content genuinely useful
- Previews should create desire, not confusion
- Clear, honest messaging about limitations

### Conversion Optimization
- Track conversion funnel: attempts â†’ previews viewed â†’ signups
- A/B testing potential for messaging and restriction levels
- Analytics on which platform previews drive most interest

### Future Enhancements
- Seasonal increases (5 attempts during holidays)
- Referral bonuses for additional attempts
- Email capture for extended trial (if privacy policy allows)

## Success Metrics
- Guest engagement rate (% who use multiple attempts)
- Preview click-through rate (interest in other platforms)
- Conversion rate (guest â†’ registered user)
- Content quality satisfaction (Twitter-only users)

## Development Notes
- Integrate with existing authentication state management
- Follow current localStorage patterns
- Maintain privacy-first architecture
- Use existing UI components and styling
- Respect current module structure
